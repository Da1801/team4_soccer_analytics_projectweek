    "## Advanced Queries for Soccer Analytics\n",
    "\n",
    "SQL's power for soccer analytics extends far beyond basic queries. With advanced SQL techniques like window functions, Common Table Expressions (CTEs), and recursive queries, we can extract meaningful insights about game dynamics and team performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Possession Analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the most valuable applications is possession analysis. This complex query example demonstrates how to:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Identify Possession Changes** - Track when the ball transfers from one team to another\n",
    "2. **Create Possession Sequences** - Group consecutive actions by the same team\n",
    "3. **Analyze Possession Effectiveness** - Evaluate how teams use their possession time\n",
    "\n",
    "CTEs (Common Table Expressions) are especially useful for building these analyses step by step:\n",
    "\n",
    "- `action_changes` - Uses LAG/LEAD window functions to identify team transitions\n",
    "- `possession_markers` - Flags the start of new possessions\n",
    "- `possession_sequences` - Groups actions into possession sequences\n",
    "- `possession_stats` - Calculates statistics for each possession\n",
    "\n",
    "### Benefits of Advanced Queries\n",
    "\n",
    "Advanced SQL queries enable sophisticated analyses:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Identify which teams maintain longer possessions\n",
    "- Find patterns in how possessions end (shots, turnovers, etc.)\n",
    "- Analyze the effectiveness of different possession strategies\n",
    "- Study how possession relates to game outcomes\n",
    "\n",
    "### Performance Considerations\n",
    "\n",
    "When working with large datasets like tracking data, query optimization becomes crucial:\n",
    "- Use appropriate indexes on commonly filtered columns (game_id, player_id, etc.)\n",
    "- Consider materializing intermediate results for complex analyses\n",
    "- Test queries on subsets of data before running on full datasets\n",
    "\n",
    "These advanced queries form the foundation for higher-level soccer analytics, such as expected goals (xG) models, pressing metrics, and tactical pattern recognition."
